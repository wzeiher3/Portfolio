            <!-- <p>As a student who has been working with programming languages for several years now, 
              I have always had a great time working on a ton of exciting projects like Battleship, Mancala, 2048, 
              and my own RPG videogame</p> -->

              <p>I'm a full stack web developer and a computer engineering student at Georgia Tech</p>

              <p>Born and raised in Atlanta, GA, I have always been excited about the advancement of technology. My passion is using creative
                 and intuitive design to transform the way we interact in the digital space. The constant innovation 
                happening in the industry has made me so excited to start my journey as a professional developer. 
              </p>

              <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy adventure sports, reading, playing trumpet, and engaging in new experiences</p>

            <h2>What I Will Bring to the Table:</h2>
            <p><i>I strive to always be  at the forefront of what it means to write quality code with an emphasis on
                effective communication and understanding. I believe it's crucial to teamwork and to learn 
                and grow everyday as I challenge myself to reflect my values in my work and attitude!
                I am 32 year old student studying at <a href="https://www.Thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, 
                and while born and raised in Philadelphia, PA, I have grown to love to experience anything 
                the world has to offer. While finding myself has been a life-long journey, I have always had 
                a programmer's mindset; I was the kid in the family who <em>'spoke computer'.</em> From being 
                a traveling musician, a waiter, a recording engineer, to a home health aide, with
                my storied background I have finally found a dream profession creating exemplary websites!</i></p>
